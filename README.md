# Rocket-Motor-Thrust-Stand
For a rocket motor to be SRAD(Students Developed and Researched) the thrust testing is necessary.
.
Process:
The thrust plate is connected to a Load Cell which sends the raw signal to a 24-bit analog to digital converter. It amplyfies the signal transfers it to a Microcontroller. This data is then processed for further Calculations.
.
At First the readings are to be divided by actual mass of object(grams) to get the calibration factor. This factor is used in another code to get Thrust and Total Impulse in Newtons.
.
The schematic of circuit is given in .pdf and .sch file.
